# the board contains three interfaces -- eth0, eth1, eth2 -- where eth0 is the port on the far left
# (labeled "WAN" on the standard enclosure), eth1 is a hardware switch with 6 ports lan1...lan6
# (labeled "LAN" on the standard enclosure), and eth2 is the SFP port (labeled "SFP" on the standard
# enclosure).
# We expect a USB WiFi stick that's supported by the kernel to be plugged into the box, showing
# up as wlan0.
# We'll make eth0 the WAN interface, eth1's ports + the WiFi interface
# the LAN interface, and eth2 the management interface (which an SFP
# port is total overkill for, but anyway).
